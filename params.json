In word spotting, the goal is to find all instances of a query word in a dataset of images. In recognition, the goal is to recognize the content of the word image, usually aided by a dictionary or lexicon. We propose a formulation for word representation and matching based on embedded attributes that jointly addresses these two problems. Contrary to most other existing methods, our representation has a fixed length, is low dimensional, and is very fast to compute and, especially, to compare.\r\n\r\nWe propose to use character attributes to learn a semantic representation of the word images and then perform a calibration of the scores with CCA that puts images and text strings in a common subspace. After that, spotting and recognition become simple nearest neighbor problems in a very low dimensional space. We test our approach on four public datasets of both document and natural images showing results comparable or better than the state-of-the-art on spotting and recognition tasks.\r\n\r\nThis word spotting library uses some great open-source software:\r\n\r\n* [Yael library](https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/yael/) \r\n* [VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# MATLAB Quick Start Guide\r\n\r\nTo get started, you need to install MATLAB and download the code from GitHub.
